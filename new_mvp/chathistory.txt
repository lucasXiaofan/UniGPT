La principal diferencia entre un lenguaje de programación compilado y uno interpretado es el proceso de traducción del código fuente en código ejecutable.

En un lenguaje de programación compilado, el código fuente se traduce completamente a código ejecutable en un proceso llamado compilación. Este proceso implica la utilización de un compilador, que es un programa que traduce el código fuente en código objeto o código máquina que puede ser ejecutado directamente por el sistema operativo. El código objeto se puede ejecutar sin necesidad de volver a compilarlo cada vez que se realiza un cambio en el código fuente.
