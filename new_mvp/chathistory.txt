user: do you know any uci ai classes now?
assistant: Yes, there are several AI classes offered at UCI. Here is a list of some AI-related courses that you can consider:

1. COMPSCI 171 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (4 Units): This course covers different methods of representing knowledge and their applications in heuristic problem-solving. Representations include predicate logic, semantic nets, procedural representations, natural language grammars, and search trees.

2. COMPSCI 172B - Neural Networks and Deep Learning (4 Units): This course provides a comprehensive understanding of neural networks and deep learning from various perspectives. It explores the theory of parallel distributed processing systems, algorithmic approaches for learning from data, and their applications in computer vision, natural language understanding, bioinformatics, and chemoinformatics.

3. COMPSCI 175 - Project in Artificial Intelligence (4 Units): In this course, you will have the opportunity to construct a working artificial intelligence system. You will also evaluate the system's capabilities, including the impact of knowledge representation.

4. COMPSCI 178 - Machine Learning and Data-Mining (4 Units): This course introduces the principles of machine learning and data-mining, focusing on their application to real-world datasets. Typical applications include spam filtering, object recognition, and credit scoring.

5. COMPSCI 184A - Artificial Intelligence in Biology and Medicine (4 Units): If you are interested in the intersection of AI and biology/medicine, this course is for you. It covers computational methods in molecular biology and explores computational approaches to understanding and predicting the structure, function, interactions, and evolution of DNA, RNA, proteins, and related molecules and processes.

I hope this information helps you in finding the AI classes you are looking for. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask.

Here is the response I would suggest:

Hello [Student Name],

I hope you are doing well! I saw your message about Computer Science and wanted to provide you with some resources that might be helpful.

First, you might want to check out the Computer Science Department at UCI. They have a lot of information and resources for undeclared students, including a self-assessment quiz to help you decide what classes to take. You can find the department website and the quiz here:

[Computer Science Department Website]
[Link to Computer Science Department Self-Assessment Quiz]

In addition, the Academic Advising Center also has a lot of information and resources to help you make decisions about your courses. You can find their website here:
